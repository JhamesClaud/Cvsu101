                <p> Hail Alma Mater Dear
CvSU all the way through
Seat of hope that we dream of
Under the sky so blue
Verdant fields God’s gift to you
Open our lives a new
Oh, our hearts, our hands, our minds, too
In your bossom thrive and grow.
Seeds of hope are now in bloom
Vigilant sons to you have sworn
To CvSU our faith goes on
Cradle of hope and bright vision.
These sturdy arms that care
Are the nation builders
Blessed with strength and power
To our Almighty we offer.
We Pray for CvSU
God’s Blessing be with you
You’re the master, we’re the builders
CvSU leads forever.</p>
